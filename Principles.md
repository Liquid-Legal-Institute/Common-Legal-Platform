## Preface

The legal ecosystem is undergoing an extraordinary period of change and disruption. It is being reshaped by the rapid advance in technology and the massive growth and fragmentation of the legal services market. In addition, cost pressure, regulatory overload,the challenges of scale and global reach, and changes in the work place expectation of a new generation of lawyers have been the drivers of transformation within the last decade. At the same time, entirely new expectations emerge not only regarding what the in-house legal function and their external advisors should contribute to their client’s business, but also regarding what law-makers, public administration, justice and the legal ecosystem as a whole should contribute to society.

The legal ecosystem must adapt to this disruptive change, while also reflecting the particular importance of law. Increasing digitalization and new ways of thinking also offer unprecedented opportunities to meet the new and growing demands. In 2015, the idea of a Common Legal Platform (**CLP**) was born. It was publicly presented for the first time in K. Jacob, D. Schindler, & R. Strathausen (Eds.), Liquid Legal – Transforming Legal into a Business Savvy, Information Enabled and Performance Driven Industry. The first open discussion on the CLP was initiated at the Liquid Legal Conference in 2017. In 2018, with the formation of the Liquid Legal Institute e.V., a legal structure was set up within which all stakeholders can drive the development of the CLP.

In recent years, a number of (mostly commercial) platforms have emerged that have already incorporated certain elements of the CLP. These initiatives show that the vision of a CLP is not anutopia, but a realistic option for an efficient legal ecosystem. To ensure that the various individual contributions ultimately result in a CLP that serves the interests of all, it is important to define the essential features, structure and functionality of the CLP at an early stage. For this purpose, we have drafted the following “Principles for a Common Legal Platform”.

We would like to put these Principles up for discussion and invite all members of the Liquid Legal Institute e.V., especially the authors of the second volume of the Liquid Legal series (K. Jacob, D. Schindler, & R. Strathausen (Eds.), Liquid Legal – Towards a Common Legal Platform), but also all other interested stakeholders, to comment, supplement and elaborate on these principles. To enable a truly open collaboration towards realizing the CLP, we have made the “Principles for a Common Legal Platform” available on GitHub.

Help us to shape and implement these principles. Let’s design the future!

## Principles for a Common Legal Platform (CLP)

### A. Defining the Common Legal Platform

   1. The CLP shall be intended 
   
      - to serve as an open, neutral and interdisciplinary platform;
      - to be used by individuals, corporations, legal advisors and other organizations, including law-makers, public administration and justice;
      - for co-operation, interaction and exchange in the legal domain.
   2. The CLP aims in particular at
   
      - leveraging the standardization and simplification of legal content;
      - harmonizing legal processes; 
      - facilitating legal transactions;
      - decreasing the complexity of legal tasks; as well as
      - hosting concrete data assets (e.g. commonly accepted documents and standard taxonomy), sharing knowledge and connecting people.
   3. The CLP emerges from advances in
   
      - digitalization;
      - standardization;
      - material law; 
      - methodologies;
      - education.
   4. The CLP shall facilitate access to
   
      - IT systems and applications for smooth co-operation, interaction and exchange;
      - legal content and other law-related resources;
      - a network of lawyers and non-lawyers.
   5. The CLP shall be
   
      - construed as a decentralized network;
      - based on common rules and values;
      - based on a governance that safeguards compliance with the principles for a CLP.
   6. The CLP shall be approached
   
      - from a technologically neutral perspective (tool, system and provider agnostic);
      - without regard to the particular interests of individual persons or stakeholder groups;
      - taking into account the interests of the general public and the potential of the CLP to improve access to justice.

### B. Setting up the structure and the technical standards of the Common Legal Platform

The CLP shall be intended to serve as a place for co-operation, interaction and exchange – not only between people, but also between IT systems and between    people and IT systems. The prerequisites for such co-operation, interaction and exchange in a decentralized network are connecting structural elements and technical standards. Regarding the connecting structural elements and the technical standards, the following principles should apply:

   1. Layered and modular structure of the CLP
   
      The CLP shall be constructed as a stack of technologies being composed of at least
      - an internet and network layer for communication and data exchange;
      - a security layer that assures secure and encrypted data exchange;
      - an authentication layer that assures the integrity of the participants;       
      - a data layer that allows the interoperability between the different services and components on the level of data exchange; 
      - an application layer which supports a modular extension of services and offerings.
   2. Reflecting current trends and state-of-the-art in computational technologies
   
      The structure and the technical standards of the CLP shall reflect
      - the predominantly decentral creation of data;
      - the shift towards on-edge computing; 
      - that the concept of a CLP must not be forced into the restrictive boundaries of a "data center".
   3. Interoperability and standardized interfaces 
   
      Services and applications offered via the CLP shall
      - support authentication and data encryption;
      - communicate via standardized interfaces; and
      - use an open and non-proprietary format to exchange data.
   4. Common language
      The CLP shall include
      - a set of common general-purpose markup languages which are used and understood within the entire network;
      - a legal markup language which will facilitate the conversion of legal documents into machine-readable formats in order to enable the automated creation, fulfillment and enforcement of the legal claims contained therein.
   5. Data security
      Data of the participants, of their internal or external clients and of third parties shall be
      - protected in accordance with internationally recognized technical security standards;
      - accessible for each entitled person, which beside the participant might include the client or third person, an auditor etc.; 
      - protected against unauthorized changes (e.g. by DLT).
      
 
### C. Ensure that the use of the Common Legal Platform is in the interest of all

The nature of the CLP requires that the CLP is in the interest of all. To ensure that this is the case, a system of clear defined rules and values is required that describes right actions and is valid for all participants. The fundamental rules and values shall be as follows:

   1. Key values of the CLP are
   
      - neutrality;
      - open source;
      - open standards;
      - open and non-proprietary interfaces; 
      - identifiability of the participants.
   2. Ensuring neutrality
   
      Neutrality is a crucial value of the CLP. Neutrality in this context shall mean that
      - all participants can derive the same benefits from the CLP on the same terms;
      - such spaces, especially in the context of virtual spaces (e.g. for contract negotiations), offer truly neutral ground, and that no party has more rights and options of access or inspection than others; 
      - commercial content offered on the CLP must comply with the principles for the CLP, provide the parties with neutral ground and must not prevent them from switching to other providers or other applications (no vendor lock-in).
   3. Ensuring sharing
   
      The CLP does offer a protected space, but participants of the CLP shall be fundamentally prepared
      - to share their content and services with others;
      - to operate within a reasonable scope;
      - to act in line with the relevant competition regulations.
   4. Ensuring trust
   
      All participants of the CLP shall have to ensure
      - data security;
      - data protection;
      - transparency;
      - accessibility;
      - integrity; 
      - avoidance of any kind of abuse.
      
      
 
### D. Establishing a governance structure for administrating the Common Legal Platform

To ensure that the CLP is in the interest of all, it also requires a governance (communing rules) structure that is aligned to the objective of neutrality, openness, and to form a trusted environment that supports innovations and new ideas.

   1. Objective of the governance structure
   
      - The governance structure must be designed to
      - implement the principles for a CLP;
      - establish, and monitor the compliance of, the rules and values of the CLP;
      - develop and implement widely accepted legal and technical standards;
      - moderate the evolution of the CLP;
      - offer adequate measures to resolve conflicts and disputes.
   2. Basis of the governance structure  
   
      The governance shall be based on the principles of
      - democracy;
      - diversity;
      - transparency.
   3. Mitigating risks
   
      The governance structure must be capable of preventing certain negative impacts, in particular:
      - abuse of the CLP by individuals, criminal organizations or authoritarian regimes;
      - discrimination and exclusion; 
      - unfair competition.
   4. The Liquid Legal Institute
   
      The Liquid Legal Institute e.V. is designed to
      - serve as a platform to initiate, develop and establish the CLP;
      - unite stakeholders to form a community supporting the CLP; 
      - setting the rules and articulating the values of the CLP.
